## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Use the table above to help populate the env file

### 3. Configure Supabase

Connect to your remote supabase project

```bash
supabase init
```

```bash
supabase link
```

There is a migration file [here](supabase/migrations/20250225171720_init.sql) which will set up the database table and necessary RLS policies. You apply it with the following command:

```bash
supabase db push
```

#### Setting up storage

You must also create a new public bucket in both you local and remote supabase instances. Sadly there's no clean way to manage this with migrations yet (that I have found)

1. Go to Supabase Studio, then to Storage, and click "New bucket".
2. Check "Public", give the bucket a name, confirm to create the bucket
3. Click "Policies", add a policy to `INSERT` to the `anon` profile

The bucket must be public or you will not be able to view the images from the recipe emails or front-end (when that arrives...).

### 4. Configure Resend

You must verify that you own the domain that you wish to send the recipe emails from. You can do this from the [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/domains).

### 4. Run the app

```bash
npm run start
```

### 5. Deploy the app (if you want)

When pushed to a github repository this project will run on the schedule defined in the on Saturday mornings at 4am.

First you must add all environment variables to your repository settings (Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions).

You can update the schedule in the [workflow file](.github/workflows/schedule.yaml)
